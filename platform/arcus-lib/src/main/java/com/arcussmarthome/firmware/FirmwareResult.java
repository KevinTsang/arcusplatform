/**
 * Encapsulates the results of looking for a firmware update.
 * 
 * There are four types of results that are currently defined. The target firmware will only
 * be set if the result is Result.UPGRADE_NEEDED, otherwise it will be null.
 * 
 * Result.UPGRADE_NEEDED - A firmware upgrade is needed. The target will be set to the firmware to use.
 * 
 * Result.UPGRADE_NOT_POSSBILE - The current firmware cannot be upgraded to a current version. This is an error condition.
 * 
 * Result.UPGRADE_NOT_NEEDED - The current firmware does not need to be upgraded. This is not an error condition.
 * 
 * Result.NO_UPGRADES_AVAILABLE - There are not firmware targets available. This indicates the platform is jacked.
