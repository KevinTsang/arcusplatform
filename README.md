Arcus is an open-source home automation and control system, based on the Iris by Lowes codebase.
This project contains the files necessary to run Arcus Platform, including the backend services and portions of the hub (agent).


# Other Repositories

Arcus Platform does not contain a UI (beyond oculus, which is in Java). If you wish to access Arcus from a phone or web browser check out the other repositories under arcus-smart-home.

# Quick Start
Please see doc/quickstart.md for details. At present, local development is tricky to get setup and takes a considerable amount of time to configure. It is instead recommended that you setup Arcus in a container system, for example Kubernetes. See the community effort [arcus-k8](https://github.com/wl-net/arcus-k8) for details.
