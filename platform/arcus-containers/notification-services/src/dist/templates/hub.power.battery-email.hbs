Your Hub Has Switched to Battery Backup
{{/section}}

{{#section "plaintext-body"}}
Hi {{{_person.firstName}}},

The hub at {{{_place.name}}} has lost AC power and switched to battery backup.
This may be because the hub has been unplugged or power at the place has been lost.

We recommend checking the Arcus hub and restoring power as soon as possible to maintain 
service. You will receive an email when the hub is reconnected.
