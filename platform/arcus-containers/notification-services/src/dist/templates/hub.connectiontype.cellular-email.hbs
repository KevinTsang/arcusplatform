Your Hub Has Switched to Cellular Backup
{{/section}}

{{#section "plaintext-body"}}
Hi {{{_person.firstName}}},

The hub at {{{_place.name}}} has lost broadband connectivity and switched to cellular backup.
This may be because the ethernet cable has been unplugged or power at the place has been lost.

We recommend checking the Arcus hub and restoring broadband connection as soon as possible to
maintain service.  You will receive an email when the hub is reconnected.
