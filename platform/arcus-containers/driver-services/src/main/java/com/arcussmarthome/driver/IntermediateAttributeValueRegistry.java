/**
 * This class contains attribute values which are of an intermediate state.  For instance, when a lock is unlocked,
 * the unlock value is sent from the client message to the driver for the lockstate attribute.  The driver then sets
 * value of the lockstate to unlocking. Once the device reports a lockstate change, the driver then updates the lockstate
 * value to unlocked.  Thus, unlocking is considered an intermediate value.
 *
 * This is useful for instance if we want the actor context to not be destroyed for an intermediate value and to be associated
 * with the final state change as well.
