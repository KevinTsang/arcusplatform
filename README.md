# Other Repositories

Arcus Platform does not contain a UI (beyond oculus, which is in Java). If you wish to access Arcus from a phone or web browser check out the other repositories under arcus-smart-home.

# Quick Start
Please see [Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) for details. At present, local development is tricky to get setup and takes a considerable amount of time to configure. It is instead recommended that you setup Arcus in a container system, for example Kubernetes. See the community effort [arcus-k8](https://github.com/wl-net/arcus-k8) for details.

# Overview of codebase
