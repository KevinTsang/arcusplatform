/**
 * A note about the threading model:
 *
 * All of the notification dispatching is suppose to happen on a single thread pool. When
 * a notification is initially received from the message bus the dispatch is immediately
 * attempted on this thread pool, but if the notification needs to be split or retried then
 * that code will call into one of the methods in this class.
 *
 * Since we don't want to deadlock, this class cannot immediately place the retry attempt
 * or split notification back into the same thread pool. Instead a much smaller thread
 * pool with an infinite sized queue is used with the tasks on this thread pool simply
 * scheduling a dispatch on the notification dispatching thread pool.
